## Introduction

Recently, the healthcare industry has experienced a tremendous surge in the **volume of data** being generated and gathered. Conventional methods of **processing** and **storing** data are struggling to keep pace with the sheer **magnitude**, **speed**, and **diversity** of this influx of **big data**, necessitating innovative solutions.

**Big data analytics and cloud computing** have emerged as key technologies, providing scalable and efficient tools for handling, analyzing, and storing extensive datasets in healthcare.

This project focuses on predicting the length of **hospital stays** (LOS) using the **MIMIC-III** database. **MIMIC-III** is a publicly accessible database containing comprehensive clinical data from more than 40000 patients admitted to various ICUs (intensive care units).

Predicting LOS is crucial for effective hospital management, enabling healthcare providers to optimize resource allocation, as the goal is to develop a precise prediction model for LOS that can support healthcare professionals and hospital administrators.

Therefore in this project we aim to showcase the effectiveness of **big data analytics and cloud computing solutions** in extracting valuable insights from large-scale healthcare data.
